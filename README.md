# music
some coding for music

currently under construction so to say

Switching from C++ to python, since python has pickle as a standard libary
which makes saving and loading complex types/ classes very easy, while C++
does not support something like that from the std.
External packages are not wanted, since this should run on every Linux (Ubuntu)
PC without downloading anything extra.
